DEVELOPERS:

DESCRIPTION:
CharityBox is a website that allows users to donate to various charities all organized on a central
platform. we developed this software with the intent of applying our knowledge of solid
design principles, scrum and agile framworks, and good software architecture.

TOOLS NECESSARY:
* Eclipse
* MYSQL
* Tomcat 9.0
* Brackets/Visual Studio 

INSTALLATION:
* First, we used Eclipse so we could use java to create logic for our backend. The way to download Eclipse is simple click this link below and select the operating system you are using. Secondly, we used MySQL to create the database in which interacted with Apache Tomcat 9.0 which allowed us to connect to Eclipse to test our functions such as, login, registration, and organization registration. Below in the links you will see two links the first one is a link to download MySQL while the second one is a video tutorial that you can follow to download MySQL properly, along with a link to install Tomcat 9.0. As for the front end we used a mixture of Brackets and Visual Studios to create the visuals for CharityBox this includes the slideshow, FAQ page, layout of the website, and more features. The links below give you the option to use either Visual Studios 2019 or Brackets to create your front end. By using a cumulation of these software we were able to create CharityBox.
